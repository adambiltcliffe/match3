# match3
Everyone makes a match-3 game at some point. In my case this was an exercise in implementing the falling mechanics in the vein of Candy
Crush whereby once tiles are settled, they can form part of a match with other settled tiles even though tiles elsewhere in the grid may
still be falling.

Not implemented:
* Preventing the initial grid from containing matches
* Preventing the player from making swaps that don't create a match
* Any kind of scoring, win or loss condition, or anything else that makes it a game ...
